# Project Name: Lab-02 jQuery and the DOM

**Author**: Jackie-Jesse
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- The project is a blog app that populates the page with blog articles. -->

## Getting Started
<!-- The user only needs to navigate to the site in order to read the blog posts. -->

## Architecture
<!-- We used the jQuery library to manipulate DOM elements to the page.  Additionally, we implemented the forEach method to replace the for loops.  This was used to render information to the page. -->

## Change Log
<!-- 
03-17-2001 1420 - We successfully made a constructor function.
03-17-2001 1500 - We pushed blog information, like the text and author information, to an array and then render that to the page with a forEach method.
03-17-2001 after 1500 - We cleaned up the CSS code. -->
