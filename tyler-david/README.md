# Project Name

**Author**: Tyler Confalone and David Johnson
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
 As a user I am looking for a site that will display my blog articles clearly and logically so I can find things in them quickly and so they are easy to read in an order of most recent artcicles first.
As a developer I am using jQuerys library to create a functionl effecient way to traverse, access, and manipulate the DOM.  As a developer I also want my code to be dry as possible.  Optimize iteration with JavaScript array methods, this helps keep my coder more condensed and maintainable.

## Getting Started
As a user would need to create an array similar to the rawData that is used in this example.  that is the information that we will than use to fill in our web page.  They would need to than create a constructor function to pull the information off of the rawData.

## Architecture
we put the html and body tags in a base.css 
we put template none and clearfix in the module
layout helped move the mobile around (mobile first) and controlled the hamburger action
