This site provides handful of information on blogs with many articles, authors and links to their biography
## Getting Started

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
Application is divided into three major modules: HTML, CSS, JS. It is a single page web design that includes CSS styles, JS DOM manipulations and mobile first design rules. jQuery is very handy in terms of traversing DOM and assign the data.
