## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
The purpose of this version of the application is to utilize jQuery and associate it with the DOM. We wanted to improve the user experiene by displaying the blogs in order from most recent to oldest. From there we made our code DRY and rendered articles from a seperate data file so that the HTML file would be less cluttered and more readable.
